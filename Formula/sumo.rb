  def caveats; <<~EOS
    In order to let X11 start automatically whenever a GUI-based SUMO application
    (e.g., "sumo-gui") is called, you need to log out and in again.
    Alternatively, start X11 manually by pressing cmd-space and entering "XQuartz".

    You might want to set your SUMO_HOME environment variable:
      export SUMO_HOME="#{prefix}"
  EOS

    # This test will fail and we won't accept that! For Homebrew/homebrew-core
    # this will need to be a test that verifies the functionality of the
    # software. Run the test with `brew test sumo-src`. Options passed
    # to `brew install` such as `--HEAD` also need to be provided to `brew test`.
